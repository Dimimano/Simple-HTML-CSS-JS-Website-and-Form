# Simple-HTML-CSS-JS-Website-and-Form

This project was an assigment i had to complete in order finish my Web Development course in University of Macedonia. The site (index.html) features 3 different pages the user can switch to, each containing information and multimedia (images,videos etc) on rap artists. As a second part, a form was created (form.html) that collects the input and validates it. It was made using only HTML, CSS and Javascript.
